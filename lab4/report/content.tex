\section{Gradient Computation}
I managed to successfully write the functions to correctly compute the gradient analytically.
I tested my implementation by computing the gradients using ComputeGradsNum.m.
Then I compared my results with the numerical approaches by calculating the relative difference of each gradient element.
The relative errors shown in Table \ref{tab:grad_err} seem reasonable and I therefore conclude that my calculations are correct.
\begin{table}[ht]

    \caption{Relative error of gradient computation}

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}

               & \textbf{m=3} & \textbf{m=100} \\ \hline
    \textbf{b} & 3.03E-08     & 2.34E-08       \\ \hline
    \textbf{c} & 1.27E-09     & 1.17E-09       \\ \hline
    \textbf{U} & 6.73E-08     & 1.23E-06       \\ \hline
    \textbf{W} & 1.20E-04     & 5.00E-03       \\ \hline
    \textbf{V} & 6.38E-07     & 8.37E-06       \\ \hline
